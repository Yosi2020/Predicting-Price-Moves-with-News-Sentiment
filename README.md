### Nova Financial Solutions | Predictive Analytics Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the financial forecasting capabilities of Nova Financial Solutions by analyzing the sentiment expressed in financial news headlines and exploring how this sentiment correlates with stock price movements.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform detailed sentiment analysis on financial news headlines.
- Calculate relevant technical indicators for stock market analysis.
- Analyze statistical correlations between news sentiment scores and daily stock returns.
- Provide actionable insights to support strategic investment decisions.

## ✅ Project Tasks

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Compute descriptive statistics for headline length and article frequency.
- Identify active publishers and their publication patterns.
- Extract common financial topics using natural language processing (NLP).
- Conduct time-series analysis to identify trends and significant market event patterns.

### 2. Technical Indicators Analysis

- Prepare stock market data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
- Calculate essential technical indicators:
    - Moving Averages (MA-50, MA-200)
    - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
    - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Visualize these indicators to identify meaningful patterns.

### 3. Sentiment and Correlation Analysis

- Conduct sentiment analysis on news headlines using NLP tools (TextBlob, NLTK).
- Align sentiment data with corresponding daily stock returns.
- Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients to evaluate sentiment-stock movement relationships.
